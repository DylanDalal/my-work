TaskManager Application provides a full User Interface written in
Xamarin.Forms for local user interaction with a WebAPI. The goal
of the application is to allow users to keep track of upcoming
tasks and appointments; the list function can display these instances
in order of user-inputted priority, date, or completion. The WebAPI
is written using the .NET framework and locally saves inputted tasks
to a JSON file for persistent usage of the API.
