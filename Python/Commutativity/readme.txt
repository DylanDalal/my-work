In order to determine whether or not the different properties of addition and multiplication
have an impact on the way the brain solves math problems, I'm writing a number of functions
that analyze responses to a simple prompt: using 'these' numbers and 'these' operators, reach
'this' result. I am currently working to implement the commutative properties of addition and
multiplication.
