"Data Structures"
COP4530
October 11, 2020

Ground-up implementation of the List data structure using a system of custom 
Node objects linked by pointers. Probably my most in-depth class implementation,
complete with overloaded operators, a user interaction menu and fun things like
the "remove_if" function.
